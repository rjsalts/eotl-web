<p class=ss>
EotL is the only mud where you can play chess (and even bughouse) using a
graphical client as an interface.
You can get <b>WinBoard</b> and <b>XBoard</b> from
<a href="http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/personal/Tim_Mann/chess.html"
>some guy's page at Digital</a>, and there's a mac client at the
<a href="http://www.freechess.org/download/d_mac.html">Free Internet
Chess Server</a>,
and you might be able to get some of {these others} to work, too.
</p>

<h3>What is Bughouse?</h3>

<p class=ss>
Bughouse is four-player/two-team chess.  You team up with another player who
also has a chessboard, and then you find another pair of players teamed up
in like fashion.
The color you play is random, and your partner gets the opposite color on
his/her board, so each team has one black and one white player.
</p>

<p class=ss>
Whenever you capture a piece, it's taken off the board and handed to your
partner, who in turn passes to you whatever he/she captures.  These captured
pieces are your <i>arsenal</i>, and on your turn you can either make a normal
chess move or take one piece out of your arsenal and drop it anywhere on the
board (with a few exceptions).
</p>

<p class=ss>
Your team wins and both games end when either you or your partner captures a
king, or when one of your opponents resign.  Or, if one board draws, the other
game is halted and neither team wins.
