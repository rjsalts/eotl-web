<h1>Hoserfest II: December 16, 1995</h1>

<p>
Once again, the golden horseshoe boys got together and got stinky.
The Silver "Corkscrew Cup" was on the line for who was going to imbibe
the greatest amounts of alcohol.  It was to be a hard-fought affair,
with Siddown and Maelstrom vying for the honours.
</p>
<p>
At approximately 8:10 on Saturday night, Mael, Havock, Blacksilver, Mishap,
Amararoth and some guy named Zuchov (i fergit) all poured into my humble
basement apt in downtown Toronto.  Juanvaldez opted to wank out due to exam
anxieties.  (;wank juan)
</p>
<p>
Over a few warm-up wobbly pops, we watched the Tyson-Mathison dive.  Mael 
slammed
Corona after Corona, with lemon gin chasers.  It was at this point that we all 
knew
the night would be a great success.
</p>
<p>
About 10 we streamed into the frigid night air and headed for the local pool 
hall,
The Corner Pocket.  Mael began wagering on games and promptly took a fiver from
me, although I never relinquished it.  Mael owes Siddown two pitchers of beer.
Havock played his usual spotless pool and looked dapper in his LSU shirt.
After many pitchers of Upper Canada Premium Lager, we began accosting the
wait staff in earnest.  Mael didn't get <strong>any</strong> dates, and at this point we 
began taking
photographs.  Everyone was pretty cheery and we closed the bar down and 
settled our rather monstrous bar tab.
Hooting and hollering we spewed out of the pocket and ran for Farzae, the 
College
street hot dog vender.  Blacksilver was on antibiotics and was looking pretty
glazed at this juncture.  Finally, after many public urinations and faithful
renditions of "Lola" by the Kinks, we arrived back at my apt where my lucky
roommate was relaxing.  Not for long.  
We posed topless on the snowcovered front lawn.  We all agreed this was great 
fun.
</p>
<p>
Sid and Mael and a select few began drinking again in earnest, intent upon the
Hosefest II grail.  We played Euchre and Havock worked his way to level 3
of Dark Forces, using only his fists and 3 thermal grenades.  (F**kin' eh?!)
Mael finally submitted to Sid's superior liver control and everybody basically 
passed
out wherever.  True to form, Maelstrom barfed.  This time he reached the 
bathroom.
</p>
<p>
The next day was rough.  There was a great deal of moaning and gnashing of
teeth.  Sid was heard to utter "Uhhhh, that's the last time I'm drinking heavy 
until....<br>
Oh, hell, who am I kidding?"  ^
</p>
<p>
We went to Sneaky Dees and had heaps of chips and gravy and felt even worse.
Mael woke up at the crack of noon.  My apt smelled like a mixture between a
lavatory and a cigarette factory.
</p>
<p>
Ahh, lervly.  What a party.  Guys I hope we do it again soon, and I will have 
the
pics to you this week.  They are being developed as we speak.

<ul>
  <li><a href="hoser1.jpg">Photo #1</a>: I was doing the discoslap
      emote on the couch while Havock and Zuchrom looked on.
  <li><a href="hoser2.jpg">Photo #2</a>: This is Blacksilver and Maelstrom,
      at the pool hall.  Beer was involved.  Hmm, it's all so hazy now...
  <li><a href="hoser3.jpg">Photo #3</a>: Siddown was explaining something
      very important to Maelstrom while Mishap watched in awe.  I think it
      was something lame like "navigating the information highway."
  <li><a href="hoser4.jpg">Photo #4</a>: This is a group shot of an A. A.
      meeting.  This is all we do in Canada.  Go to A. A. meetings and
      drink like fish.
  <li><a href="hoser5.jpg">Photo #5</a>: This is the "therapy" session in
      our "A. A." meetings.  I cannot go into detail, but usually it
      involves a great deal of JELLO.
  <li><a href="hoser6.jpg">Photo #6</a>: Look at Mael's eyes closely here.
      He was actually ahead of Siddown in the drinking contest at this point.
      Boggle.
  <li><a href="hoser7.jpg">Photo #7</a>: This is me shooting pool.  If I had
      missed the shot, Havock would have brained me.  I take no
      responsibilty whatsoever for whatever Mishap is doing with his right
      hand...
  <li><a href="hoser8.jpg">Photo #8</a>: Near the end of the night, after
      the bars.  Braving the frigid, Canadian winter we all posed topless
      on the front lawn in some kind of machismo, bonding thing.
      Blacksilver looks particularly buff.
