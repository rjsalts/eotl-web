In some of the following examples, the prompt is represented by:<br />

even though players may have their own customized

<a name="rules"></a>
<h3>The Rules of EotL</h3>
<p>
EotL has only two rules.<br />
<strong>Rule #1:</strong>  Have fun.<br />
<strong>Rule #2:</strong>  Don't piss off anyone bigger than you.
</p>


<a name="communication"></a>
<h3 class="hsep">Communication Basics</h3>

<p>
There are several commands that allow you to converse with other players.
<a href="http://www.eotl.org/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?commands+say"><em>say</em></a>
is the command you use to speak to everyone in the same room as you.
The single quote can be used as a substitute for the <em>say</em> command.
You can also
<a href="http://www.eotl.org/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?commands+color"><em>color</em></a>
your messages.  E.g.</p>

<p class="mypre">
&gt; say What's up?<br />
You say: What's up?<br />
&gt; color say yellow,blue bold<br />
Color set for <span style="color: yellow; background: blue;"><b>say</b></span>.<br />
&gt; 'Any rogues online today?<br />
<span style="color: yellow; background: blue;"><b>You say:</b></span> Any rogues online today?<br />
<span style="color: yellow; background: blue;"><b>Reeses says:</b></span> Yep!
</p>

<p>
To talk to a single person in private, no matter what room he/she/it is in, you use the
<a href="http://www.eotl.org/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?commands+tell"><em>tell</em></a>
command.</p>

<p class="mypre">
&gt; tell beckster May I have a privchat?<br />
You tell Beckster: May I have a privchat?<br />
Beckster tells you: Sure thing!
</p>

<p>
For more more information on communication, please consult
<b><a href="http://www.eotl.org/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?basics+communication">help communication</a></b>.
</p>

<a name="adventuring"></a>
<h3 class="hsep">Adventuring</h3>

<p>
You gain
<a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?topics+experience"><em>experience points</em></a>
(exp) by killing "monsters"
and solving quests or puzzles.  You then spend your exp to raise
your
<a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?topics+stats"><em>stats</em></a>
(strength, intelligence, willpower,
constitution, dexterity, and charisma).
The higher your stats, the more they cost to raise.
</p>

<p>
Some of the equipment that you need in your adventuring are
<a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?basics+weapons"><em>weapons</em></a>
and
<a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?basics+armor"><em>armor</em></a>.
A backpack can be handy for carrying your money as
well as other items that you may come across, and it
can make your possessions harder to steal.
Use the <b>auction</b> channel for bartering and trading with
other players.
</p>

<p>
There are also several
<a href="/guilds/"><em>guilds</em></a>
that you can join and from which you can earn
<a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?topics+skills"><em>skills</em></a> and
<a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?topics+proficiencies"><em>proficiencies</em></a>
(typically used to aid combat).
</p>

<p>
Scattered around the game are <i>banks</i> for the safekeeping
of your cash and <i>lockers</i> for storing your equipment.
</p>

<p>
Much of the fun of the game is in exploring areas and general
adventuring.  However, there are "social" players who don't play
for stats and who simply prefer to interact with other players.
</p>


<a name="pk"></a>
<h3 class="hsep">Player-Killing (PK)</h3>

<p>
EotL has few restrictions on
<a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?topics+pkilling"><em>player-killing</em></a>.
<!-- Newbies under evaluation 5 are protected, as well as -->
<!-- players who are in a pk-free area -->
The only places in which players are protected are pk-free areas
(such as the Lounge at the start of the game).
</p>

<!-- In the past, the EotL administration has experimented with various
restrictions such as protecting newbies under evaluation 5,
but these restrictions were prone to abuse so they were
abandoned.  So don't ask, "Why don't you protect newbies at least?"
because we've been there and done that. -->

<p>
The issue of PK is one that is continually discussed among the EotL community.
The Gods/Janitors of EotL have established that EotL will remain a PK mud,
but the EotL Administration is looking into ways to discourage random and
senseless PK, especially in the case of new players.
</p>


<a name="mail"></a>
<h3 class="hsep">Mail</h3>

<p>
You can send mail to any existing player or wizard on the game.
On EotL (unlike many muds), the mailer is built into the player
body so you don't need to find a Post Office.
Intermud Mail is not supported on EotL.
See <b><a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?commands+mail">help
mail</a></b>.
</p>


<a name="channels"></a>
<h3 class="hsep">Channels</h3>

<p>
Channels are communication lines where players may join and
openly chat.
Useful lines for the beginning player include <b>newbie</b>,
<b>auction</b>, and <b>gossip</b>.
If you have a question, ask it first on <b>newbie</b>,
e.g.</p>

<p class="mypre">&gt; channel newbie Hi, where's a 
good place to kill around here? I'm new.<br />
</p>

<p>
Generally people are nice about that sort of thing, and
sometimes they may even give you weapons, money, or armor.
Listen to the <b>auction</b> line to get a feel for the more
popular items on the mud and how much things cost.
Listen to the <b>gossip</b> line to just get a general feel for
how people play on here.
A small warning though... People can be extremely hostile for
no reason, so take extreme precaution on your etiquette (though
that is another story).
Type
<b><a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?topics+channel">help channel</a></b>
for a brief overview of the channels and how to color them if you have ANSI
color.
The <b>channel</b> command will give you a list of available
channels.
</p>


<a name="news"></a>
<h3 class="hsep">News</h3>

<p>
News pages are similar to bulletin boards, except in the format
of news pages (like Usenet news).
Be sure to read the
<i>Player Announcements Page</i>, <i>Player Bug Reports Page</i>,
and <i>Player Gossip Page</i>
to keep up on all of the latest updates on EotL.
Type <b><a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?commands+news">help
news</a></b> to learn more about the news pages.
</p>


<a name="newbie"></a>
<h3 class="hsep">Mini FAQ for Newbies</h3>

<p>
<b><i>What equipment should I use and where can I get
some?</i></b><br />
There are several items that you can get for free from the
vending machine in the Lounge that can help you get started:
a map of Eternal City, a backpack (don't forget to wear it),
a Guide to EOTL, and a small dagger.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Where are good areas for newbies to
adventure?</i></b><br />
There are several <a href="/cabals/newbie.html">newbie areas</a>
designed for new players, most of which offer protection from
player killers.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>How do I raise my stats?</i></b><br />
You must go to Anestimos at the Temple of the Ages.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>What about guilds and raising skills?</i></b><br />
First, you must find a guild and join it. Once you're a member,
you can raise skills and proficiencies in various weaponry.
Guilds are a must on this mud.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Wow.. those guilds and stuff sound pretty cool.
Where can I join them?</i></b><br />
The directions to the guilds are well-guarded (well, sort of)
by the members of each guild, and it is best to consult the
members of the guild directly for information on each one.
Be careful in who you ask, as some guilds are very secretive
and may not take kindly to strangers.
Type <b>who -g</b> to list all the players by their guilds.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>Wow... that monster really kicked my tail! I'm hurt!
What can I do to speed up healing?</i></b><br />
First, get out of the room so the monster can't keep hitting
you. Next, type <b>rest</b> to make yourself lie down. This
will increase your healing rate, but you cannot move while
resting.
Also, there are various healing items on the mud that will restore your stamina.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>I died!  What do I do now?</i></b><br />
You can go to Dr. Frankenstein's Body Shop and use the
<b>regenerate</b> command to get a new body (with reduced
stats).  There are a few other places on the mud where
players can regenerate as well.
</p>

<p>
<b><i>I died from a bug!  Is there a way to get my old stats
back?</i></b><br />
Read the <b><a href="/cgi-bin/display_help.pl?topics+unkills">help
unkills</a></b> file if you think you qualify for an unkill.
