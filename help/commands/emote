Command : Emote
Format  : emote <action>
Example : emote picks his nose.

The "emote" or emotion command allows the player to act out a customized
action in the room he/she is currently in.  The action is written to
the room's occupants in a manner similar to that of the "feelings."
For example:

    = If your name was "Joe" and you wanted the message "Joe barfs."
      echoed to your room, you would type:

        > emote barfs.
