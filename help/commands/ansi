Command : Ansi.
Format  : set ansi on || set ansi off

     Ansi is a way of coloring specific parts of the text that you
see on your screen.  Wizards can code ansi colors into the short
and long descriptions of rooms and objects, and certain items, such
as the Binford and the Highlighter, will color says, tells, etc
to make them easier to see.  Channels can also be colored with ansi.
     By using the <set ansi on> command, you are allowing the color to
reach you.  Do not set this variable on if your terminal does not support c
color.
     Having ansi-shorts and ansi-longs set on will not affect your screen
unless you also have ansi set on.
