Command : Page Width
format: set page-width (<number>/auto)

     This value should be the width of your terminal window,
in characters.  This may or may not be used by various things on
the mud, but it's always nice to have.  Telnet negotiation can
determine this if it's set to "auto" (default), and autoterm is
set on (only if your telnet client supports it).
