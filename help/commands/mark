Command : Mark
Format  : mark <object|all [id]|equip>
 
     Marking an object prevents it from being sold -- handy to do with
your healing or other items that aren't worn, wielded, or held.  Objects must
be unmarked before storing.
 
     <mark equip> will mark all the equipment you're wearing/wielding,
<mark all> will mark your entire inventory, and <mark all [id]> will mark 
everything matching "id" (so "mark all armor" will mark all the armor in 
your inventory).
