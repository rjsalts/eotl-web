Before you apply to become a wizard, you should read both the Frob Applications
Page and its companion page, the Frob Applications Review Page.  Doing so will 
give you a feel for what separates a good application from a bad application.
 
Be sure you take time to proofread what you wrote by using the ~p command on
any blank line.  This is your chance to become a wizard; if you don't take it
seriously, then we won't take you seriously. 
 
You must also sacrifice a ritual chicken and chant strange mantras while
dancing naked around an open fire to the sound of tribal war drums.
