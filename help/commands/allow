Command : Allow.
Format  : allow <who> || allow all

     If a player wishes to tail after you, using the <follow> command,
you have the choice of allowing them to or not.  Should you wish to
let them, the 'allow' command is used to do so.  Should several players
be wishing to follow you at the same time, you may <allow all> to
save yourself the trouble of allowing each of them individually.
