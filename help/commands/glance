Command : Glance.
Format  : glance || glance <thing> || glance at <thing> || glance in <thing>
Example : glance fountain

     Virtually the same as the 'look' command, glance will respect having
brief on.  Thus, if you glance at a room and have <set brief on>, you will
see only the short description and the contents of that room.

See also: look, brief
