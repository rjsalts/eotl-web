Format  : get <item>, get <item> from <item2>, get all, get all from <item>

This command will allow you to get items from the room you are in or from
an item in your inventory.  Simply typing 'get <item>' will get the <item>
you have specified from the room you are in.  Typing 'get <item> from
<item2>' will get the <item> from <item2> in your inventory.

Some items are not gettable because they may either be permanant objects
in the room or they may be too heavy for you to carry.
