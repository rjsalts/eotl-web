Command : Group.
Format  : group <subcommand> <arguments> 
Example : group invite Duncan

-- Beginning a group:
     Any player may be in a group, simply by inviting another player to 
group with them.  The first player becomes the leader of the group.

     Leader's commands:

        group invite <player>   - invite <player> to join the group
        group leader <member>   - pass leadership of the group onto <member>
        group name <name>       - (re)name the group <name>
        group remove <member>   - remove <member> from the group

     Any member of the group may use the following commands :

        group accept            - accept an invitation to join a group
        group hp                - display each member's hp/mana/fatigue
        group leave             - leave the group you are currently in
        group status            - display information about the group
        group say <message>     - send <message> to every member in the group

     All arguments in the above commands are mandatory. 

     Typing <group> by itself will either display the name of the group you
are in, the name of the person / group that last invited you to join them,
or nothing.
