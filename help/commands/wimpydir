Command : Wimpy Direction
Format  : wimpydir <direction> || wimpydir random
Example : wimpydir east

     If your player has a wimpy value set (not zero) then you may also
specify a default direction for your player to attempt to flee in, should 
wimpy be called.  Should you not have any preference, the direction
may be set to 'random'.
