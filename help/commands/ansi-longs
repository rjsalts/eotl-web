Command : Ansi Longs.
Format  : set ansi-longs on || set ansi-longs off

     The longer body of text which explains the surroundings of the room
you are in is known as its 'long description.'  Some wizards use ansi
to color that description, and if you set ansi-longs on, your terminal
will use that color when displaying the paragraph.

     You must also have set ansi on to see the color of ansi-longs.
