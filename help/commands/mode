Command : Mode.
Format  : mode <mode>
Example : mode say
 
     The mode command puts you in a "mode," where all commands you type
will be appended to <mode> first.  So if you did <mode say>, you would
say anything that you typed.  Typing <**> or <.> on an empty line will
take you out of mode.  
 
NOTE:  If you want to escape out of mode you will need to use a double
bang (ie. <!!look> instead of just <!look>).
