Topic : Player Killing.

On End of the Line, player killing is allowed, although not encouraged.  Why
you choose to kill someone is not our business, but before you do, you should
be aware of a few things:

    = Killing a player will not reward you with any experience points.
 
    = Killing players in excess will be noted by wizards, and even though
      player killing is allowed, something bad might happen to you.  
 
    = There exist areas on the mud where player killing is not allowed.
      Players who wish to avoid getting pkilled are encouraged to game in
      those areas.
