Topic : Death.
 
     When your hitpoints go below the negative value of your constitution
stat, you die.  This results in you leaving your body and becoming a ghost.
Ghosts do not have access to all of the commands that the living do, and
they cannot carry items, be attacked, be followed by anyone, or join a
group.  You can go to Dr. Frankenstein's lab in Eternal City, or one of  
several lesser-known locations, to reunite with your body.  When you
regenerate you will have lost 10% of your stats and skills, though they
will never drop below the base level for your race.  You will also lose any
experience points you were carrying.
