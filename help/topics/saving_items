Topic : Saving Items.

-- Lockers:
     Players may save and retrieve their items at any locker throughout
the mud.  Lockers are generally located in inns, hotels and the like.
Storage is not free, however, and the price of keeping an item increases
vs. time at a linear rate until, at 15 days, the player must pay the full
value of the item to retrieve it.

     Locker thieves are known to exist.

-- Banks:
     Money may be deposited and withdrawn from any bank throughout the mud.
EotL banks offer no interest, nor do they charge account-keeping fees.
