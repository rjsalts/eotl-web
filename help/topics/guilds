Topic : Guilds.
 
     By joining a guild, a player has access to training facilities
for proficiencies, and to the skills particular to that guild.  Guild access
is open to everybody, but may be require a certain level of alignment, eval,
stat or proficiency to join.  Guild halls are spread throughout the realm.
You can be a member of only one guild at a time, and one subguild, or
"specialization".
 
     You may join or leave a guild at any time, within their requirements,
but mistakes can be costly.  Joining a guild will set your current exp to
zero, and leaving one will remove all your private guild skills and remove or
lower your proficiencies.  The moral is to choose with care. :)
