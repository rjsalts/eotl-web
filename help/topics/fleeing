Topic : Fleeing.

     Should a battle become too much for you, you may flee from the combat.
The monster or player you are fleeing from will be able to take a few 
swings at you as you run away.

NOTE: There is no flee bug.  It's a feature [tm].
If you don't want to die through fleeing, don't use wimpy.
