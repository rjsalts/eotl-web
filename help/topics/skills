Topic : Skills.

     Players may train in a wide variety of skills to improve their chances
of survival on the mud.  Skills are offered by guilds and subguilds.
 
     Weapon-based skills are known as 'proficiencies'.  See
<help proficiency> for further details.

     To display your skills and their respective levels, use the 'list'
command.

     To display information about skills you are already trained in, 
<help skill [skillname]> may be used.
