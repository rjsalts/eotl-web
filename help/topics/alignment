Topic : Alignment.

       The alignment of a player is a cummulative representation of how
good or how evil that player is.  Your alignment is affected by the
alignment of the monsters you kill, and certain objects on the mud.
The alignment of a monster is set upon its creation, and generally
does not change.

     There are several guilds upon EotL in which alignment plays a 
major part.  Alignment can also influence the armor you can wear, weapons
you can wield, and even the areas you can enter.

     Your alignment is a number, represented by the following scale:

          Angelic
          Saintly
          Very Good
          Good
        - Neutral -
          Evil
          Very Evil
          Devilish
          Demonic

     You can see your current alignment by using the <score> command.
