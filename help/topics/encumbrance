Topic : Encumbrance.
 
     Your encumbrance is the total weight you are able to carry in your
inventory.  This value is dependent upon your strength.  Items carried
in other items, such as backpacks, sacks, etc, are counted as 2/3rds of
their true weight.
 
     You may see how encumbered you are by using the 'score' command.
You may not be able to collect any more items if your encumbrance is high.
