Topic : Proficiencies

     Training in a proficiency helps the player gain a better knowledge and
understanding of the best usage of an item which has that proficiency.  Not
all proficiencies are weapon-based, though it is these sorts that a player
will come into contact with often.  Wielding a weapon of a proficiency type you
have trained in will make your more effective in combat.

     To display your proficiencies, type <list proficiencies>.

     Proficiencies are generally offered by guilds and specs.
