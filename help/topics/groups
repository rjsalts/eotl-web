Topic : Groups.

     Grouping allows several players to combine their strengths as they
adventure thoughout the mud.  For the specific commands used to begin and
run a group, please see the <help group> file.

     When any group member kills a monster, the exp gained is split 
among the members of the group who are present in the same room.
This split is based upon the eval of each player.
