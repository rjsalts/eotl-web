Topic : regexp
 
The term "regexp" is an abbreviation for "regular expression," and can 
be used to do really neat filters and searches on strings.  The 
following describes how regexp matches operate:
 
     . Match any character.
     
     ^ Match begin of line.
     
     $ Match end of line.
     
     \< Match begin of word.
     
     \> Match end of word.
 
     \B not at edge of a word (supposed to be like the emacs
        compatibility one in gnu egrep), since 3.2@249
 
     x|y Match regexp x or regexp y.
     
     () Match enclosed regexp like a 'simple' one.
     
     x* Match any number (0 or more) of regexp x.
     
     [..] Match one of the characters enclosed.
     
     [^ ..] Match none of the characters enclosed. The .. are to
     replaced by single characters or character ranges:
     [abc] matches a, b or c.
     [ab0-9] matches a, b or any digit.
     [^a-z] does not match any lowercase character.
     
     \c match character c even if it's one of the special characters.
     
     If there is an error in the regular expression 0 will be
     returned.  Remember that the character "\" has to be escaped
     with a "\" when written as a LPC string.
