Topic: Feelings.
Format : feelings
         feelings <substring>
 
This command will display a list of all of the available feelings to you.
Feelings increase the variability of ways you can interact with other
players or monsters on the mud.
 
The second format of the feelings command will display all the available
feelings that contain that substring.  For example: "feelings ab" will
display all the feelings that contain the string "ab".  Note that doing
"feelings a" does NOT produce all the feelings that begin with "a", but
all the feelings that contain an "a".
 
Feelings can be used in several ways.  Simply typing out the feeling
without arguments will cause your player to act out that feeling.  By
adding arguments, the feeling can be directed at another player or monster,
or can be customized.
 
    Example: smile awkwardly
 
The above example will cause you to 'smile awkwardly' so that people in
the same room as you will see a message stating that you are smiling
awkwardly.
 
    Example: smile <thing>
 
The above example will cause you to smile that the <thing> you have written
in.  You can direct feelings to other players and monsters in this fashion.
 
    Example: smile <thing> awkwardly
 
The above example will cause you to smile at the <thing> awkwardly.
Everyone in the room will know that you are smiling at <thing> awkwardly,
and the <thing> will know that it is being smiled at by you.

If you want to preview what a feeling will produce, type "help <feeling>".

Play around with the feelings on the Mud.  Have fun with them!
