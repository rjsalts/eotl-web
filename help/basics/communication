     How to communicate with other players on EotL.

1.  Say.                      Format: say <message>
--  Everyone in the same room, including you, sees your message.

2.  Tell.                     Format: tell <who> <message>

    to be in the same room as you.

--  Each player you include will see the message.  There is no limit to
    the number of players you can group tell at the same time.

4.  Whisper.                  Format: whisper <who> <message>
--  You can only whisper to someone in the same room as you.  Other
    players will see you whispering, but will not know what you've said.

    They will see your name, followed by the message.

6.  Reply.                    Format: reply <message>

    use reply.  To reply to everyone in a group tell, use the format:
    reply -a <message>.

    tell to.

    "mode" for more information on how to use it.
    
9.  Shout.                    Format: shout <message>
--  Only wizards can shout.  Should you wish to express your message
