Yes, I am happy to help players.  Please note the following:

a.  If the bug is urgent, or affects gameplay / balance, please send me a tell.
     Be clear, be concise.  Explain the specific nature of the problem.

b.  If the bug is cosmetic or non-urgent, please post it on the bugs page.

c.  It's very unlikely I will know if this weapon has been changed,
     or if that piece of armor is offline.  Check the news pages or
     mail the cabal with <mail :cabalname>.  

d.   None of the above; use your own judgment.

Sending me a tell implies you've read and agreed with the above.  This
agreement does not void your constitutional rights, and you may have other
rights as vary from state to state
