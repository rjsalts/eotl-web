All right girls, here is the drill.  We are not here to be heroes, got
that?  That's not our job.  Our job is to make sure our contract gets
his ass out of the fire un-singed.  I don't care how much you try to
make yourself look cool or shit, but you do your god-damned job.
We are here to make money.  And we make our money by keeping other
people out of hot shit.  Whether it is some pansy-ass Caster, or just
someone with more important things to think about don't matter none.
What matters is that we get paid, the contract is happily un-scathed,
and we have a good business reputation.
<BR>
Some of you may have these hallucinations about becoming rich and
famous; well, I got a wake up call for ya: yer more likely to
wake up dead.  We tend to step on a few toes in our line of work.  
But if you are smart and keep your ass and your contract's ass out
of the really hot shit, you should live a pretty damn good life.
<br>
Oh yeah, the babes aren't bad either.
