From the Archlector Yyelth, The Eminance:
</p>
<p><i>
<img src="/img/clr.gif" hspace=10 width=1 height=1 alt=" ">
        It has occurred to me that some of our younger
acolytes do not know much about the history of the guild
or how we came about.  This is very disturbing, for in our
history is our future.  Without knowing where we have been
and what we have done, how can we choose the enlightened
paths and proceed down them with confidence?  It seems that
a few of the Lectors might have to hold history sessions
this upcoming winter...
</i></p>
<p><i>
<img src="/img/clr.gif" hspace=10 width=1 height=1 alt=" ">
        Our roots began not as priests of Adon, but as the
Templar Knights.   The Templar Knights were formed by the
High Bishop le Bel in 2312.1e under the premise of defending
the Holy Sepulchre against any foe.  As unbelievable as it
may sound, the dustmen did not exist at that time, for the
Dark Ones were still mortal.  That is another lesson, which
should be imparted to you at a later date.  Anyways, I drift.
The Knights were formed and grew prosperous under the guidance 
of le Bel until his untimely death in 2320.7e. It is still 
not known how he was slain in his quarters with guards posted
at every entrance.  Alas, we will probably never know the truth.
The kings that controlled the various provinces respected and
promoted the Templars, allowing them indiscriminate policing
actions.  The Knights were trained as priest/warriors and saw
their first major engagement at the Second War of Nacosin,
where their presence decided the battle against the barbarian
invaders.  Soon after began the rebuilding process in which the
Knights participated, thus extending the debt that the
population owed them.  
</i></p>
<p><i>
<img src="/img/clr.gif" hspace=10 width=1 height=1 alt=" ">
        The Templars had problems with the general populance
as well.  In 2415.5e, a small group of Knights were dispatched
to the remote village of Kersis on rumours that the town was
practially destroyed in a raid by the nearby desert-dwelling
town of Errasis-Anon.  When the relief party arrived, they 
could not believe their eyes.  Massive amounts of corpses
littered the streets and demolished buildings.  Upon further
inspection of the deceased, it was noted by Sir Jiru that many
parts of the bodies seemed to be missing, hewn off by massive
blades.  Others bore burns that disintegrated bone in some 
areas, while some of the fragments of corpses indicate a
possible internal explosion.  The atrocities were amazing,
for not only were people affected, but nature itself was 
beaten into submission by powerful magicks.  Large boulders
jutted forth from the ground into the streets, buildings seemed
partially melted by some form of acidic substance, and giant
holes in various areas contained not just a black tar, but 
the distented bodies of various forms of wildlife.  The only
building in the town that did not seem to be affected by this
was the old tower of Arcanus.  The powerful magic school was
apparently spared from this massive destruction, yet showed
no forms of obvious life.  The Knights entered the tower 
easily, ascending the stairs into the main hall.  Upon arrival,
they came across the bodies of several mages lying crumpled
in various areas in the room.  A make-shift barracade lay
in pieces around the northern passage, while scorch marks 
adorned the previously meticulous walls.  From that point on,
we do not know exactly what happened, for the only survivor
from that party was Alrienus, a high-level druid sent along
with the party.  Apparently, there was an ambush by what
appeared to be soldiers, peasants, city officials, and 
commoners from both Errasis-Anon and Kersis.  This rag-tag
group flooded the room and began to assault the Knights
with huge swords, axes, and maces.  A few of the Knights
appeared to have fought back with the help of the company's
mage until the arrival of a blue-cloaked figure.  This
figure set up a shield against the magic-user's attacks 
until the mage tired.  From there, it was just a matter of
time before the remaining barbarians hacked down our
Knights.  Alrienus had backed into a corner while fighting,
and it was only luck that he happened upon an ancient 
escape lever in which he pulled.  As he ran down the 
corridors, a voice called from behind him, "The wind is 
coming."  The druid managed to make it back our outpost
in Tretis, thus relating the story to Lector Yupij.  The
Lector soon sent out an expedition numbering 1000 strong
to reclaim the tower.  When the expedition had arrived, 
all signs of the assailants had vanished, leaving no clues
as to their identity or purpose in attacking the small
party.  The reconstruction of the Templar barracks and the
town was soon underway, thus allowing the incident to
slip into history innocuously.

        The final swan-song of the Templar Knights appeared
in the Third War of Nacosin.  By this time, The Fallen had
pushed back the Knights back to the castle holding the Holy
Sepulchre, spreading death and fear before them.  The Knights
were joined by a host of armies from the surrounding nations
that had survived the Fallen's onslaught.  I will not go into
the history of this battle, for that is another story in 
itself.  I will tell you, though, that the Knights were 
victorious throught the acts of a small band of brave warriors
who slew Aravan when he appeared in mortal form.  The rest is,
as you say, history.

        The downfall of the Templar Knights was not in any
army or mythical beast that stalked the earth; it was in 
themselves.  The Templar Knights, after the destruction
and banishment of the Fallen had taken into lives of royalty
and sin.   The local duchys had granted the Knights large
estates and local absolutism, thus fueling the demons inside
these men:

<blockquote>
    ...Lately, through the report of persons
    worthy of faith made to us, it has come
    to our attention that the brothers of the
    Knights of the Temple are disguising the
    wolf in sheep's clothing under the habit
    of the Order.  A miserable insult to the
    religion of our faith, crucifying anew 
    Our Lord who was already crucified for the
    redemption of the human race, and covering
    him with insults more severe than those he
    suffered during his Crucifixion.  At their
    entry to the Brotherhood when they make the
    profession of their vows, they are presented
    with his image and, misled by an unfortunate,
    nay, wretched blindness, they deny him three
    times and then, with terrible cruelty, spit
    three times into his face; after which 
    despoiled of the garments they wore in the
    secular life.  Naked, in the presence of him
    who receives them or his deputy, they are
    kissed by him, in conformity with the
    odious ritual of their Order; firstly,
    at the base of the spinal column, secondly,
    on the navel and, finally, on the mouth,
    to the disgrace of human dignity.  After
    they have offended divine law by 
    such abominable undertakings and such
    detestable acts, they force each other
    by the vow of their profession and without
    fear of offending human law, to abandon 
    themselves one to the other, without
    refusal, as soon as they are required, by 
    the action of the vice of a horrible and
    fearful intercourse.  And this is why the
    wrath of Adon comes crashing down on these
    sons of infidelity.  This unclean sect has
    deserted the source of the living water,
    replaced His glory with the statue of the
    Fallen One (Aravan) and it now sacrifices
    to idols.

         translated from Tilen by Lector Gyusti).

        The remaining 108 Templar Knights were arrested by 
the Archlector and put to death by impalement in the public
square in front of the Resij Cathedral.  Their land was given
back to the local duchys and re-distrubuted amongst the elder
nobles.  All talk of the Knight's deeds and the teaching of 
history was banned by the church and noble etiquette until
the Enlightener's Period of 2889.e-3000.e.  The Church had
taken a very large setback and was not trusted until the
formation of the Crusaders to push back the marauding Relinites
and crush their blasphemous ways.  I am now not only in charge
of making the people believe in us again, but to ensure 
nothing like what happened to the Templar Knights ever happens
to us.  May Adon be with you all.
