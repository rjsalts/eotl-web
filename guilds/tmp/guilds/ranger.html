"Now there was a truly unique sight," I thought to myself.
</p>
<p>
A large man was approaching from across the open plains, clad in a full suit
of leather and carrying a large bow made of bone.  On his belt, a small
sharp dagger hung within easy reach.  However, it was not the man that caught
my eye, but rather, the enormous beast that plodded on behind him.  The wolf
had curious markings on its velvety coat, and obeyed the commands of the man
who strode before him.  As the two walked towards me, I was suprised by the
almost domestic nature of the wild beast.  I spoke with the man, who came
across as a rough yet kind-hearted soul.
</p>
<p>
The wanderer explained that he was a visitor to these parts, and had been
scouring the forests of the country in search of his own kinsmen.  He had
come a great distance to meet with these Rangers, and heard rumors that they
kept to themselves high among the treetops.  The Ranger further explained to
me that the skills taught by these particular woodsmen were of an almost
magical nature.
</p>
<p>
All the while, as the man spoke of his voyages and people he had met, the
wolf sat obediently, pricking his ears up at the sounds of small animals that
scurried by.  The Ranger noticed my interest in the wondrous beast and smiled
a toothy grin.
<p>
</p>
"The creatures of the woods are our friends," the man explained to me.
"We come to depend on them when we are in distress, and in turn, treat them
as our friends."  Almost on cue, the wolf snatched a piece of raw meat from
the Ranger's hand, which he had produced from his leather pack.  "As a matter
of fact," the forest man continued, "the outdoors are filled with many, many
secrets which the average man is unaware of.  Take this root, for example."
The Ranger rubbed a small plant on my arm, where a large cut had been
inflicted upon me by a rogue warrior.  Almost immediately, I felt a strange
icy sensation within my body, and the surrounding skin around the cut began
to foam, then close up.  Within the blink of an eye, the wound had healed
dramatically.  "The skills that the wise old Rangers of the woods teach us
define the type of people we are."
</p>
<p>
We spoke for a short while longer, and my interest in the mysterious Rangers
heightened.  It was at that moment that I realized my path was clear:
I would learn the lessons of nature, and become a disciple of the ways of the
woodlands.
