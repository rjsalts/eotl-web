     So it came to be that the gaze of Aravan fell upon this
land.  Its brightly lit forests and goodly races stank to him like
the smell of refuse, but still, over it all was a sweet aroma, the
scent of death.  So he came to this land, in the shadowed corners
his words were whispered, on the night breezes they traveled,
seductively luring all those that hear them towards him.  Slowly
they came, surrendering to his promises, bowing to his dark
majesty.  Some committed to his power, bowed down and became 
his priests; these were the Order of the Dark Heart.  The 
others took up weapons to defend the guild and claim more 
souls for the glory of Aravan; these were the Fallen.
