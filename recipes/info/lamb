It's been posted before, but it's been a while and it's a damn good recipe.

2 pounds lean lamb, cubed
1 garlic clove, minced
1/2 cup olive oil
1 lemon, juiced
1 large onion, minced
1/2 cup sherry
oregano
salt and pepper
1 tomato, sliced
2 slices feta cheese, crumbled (bogleg 'slices')
butter

Mix lamb with olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, onion, sherry, 1 tsp. oregano,
salt and pepper to taste.

Brush 4 sheets of aluminum foil with olive oil, place meat in center of each
sheet.

Place 1 tomate slice on each portion, crumble feta over tomato, season with 
oregano, and place 2 pats of butter on top.

Fold the foil and crimp the edges tight.  Bake at 375 for 1 hour.
