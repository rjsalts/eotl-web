This is your basic fried rice dish.
I had a tough time getting this out of my mom because she
doesn't follow a recipe... she just makes it without thinking
about it.
You can make vegetable fried rice, or add
shrimp, beef, or chicken.
My mom likes to add ham (the kind used as sandwich meat).

  <directions>
Set the already-cooked rice aside.  I'll assume you know all about how to cook rice.
Chop up the green onions, garlic, and ginger.
Chop up carrots into julienned slices.
Chop ham slices into small bits (this is optional).
Scramble an egg.
Mom says you can add whatever else you want, like snow peas, shrimp, or chicken.
Put oil and butter in a pan.
(I asked her how much and she wasn't really sure, so just make a good guess.)
When the oil is hot, add the green onions, garlic and ginger and let them cook for 2 or 3 minutes.
When the oil is sizzling add the carrots, ham, and anything else (but not the rice and egg yet).
When all of that is cooked and nice and soft, add the cooked rice,
then add the egg, and toss in some black pepper and soy sauce, all
the while stirring the whole thing.

When my Mom serves it, she often uses a small bowl as a mold, fills it
up with the rice, and plops it on the dish, sprinkling some dried seaweed on top.
She often serves the rice with soup and teriyaki chicken.

The recipe was pretty straightforward as instructions go; measuring was hard,
since it was all eyeballing, but i'd say that this
is a good standard recipe.<
