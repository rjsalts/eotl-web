sausage balls [David, Thu Aug 16 19:15:28] 1663

so, there was this party a few weeks ago that some of us went to (it was at deathdealer's
place, etc.), and this one person there made what I believe she called "Tennessee Sausage
Balls" (and yeah, if I'm failing to spell ten-uh-see, sorry, but yeah)...  they were kinda
nummy, and so, when I saw her again later, I asked her how she made 'em.

Here's the low down:

1 tube Jimmy Dean sausage
1 lb. cheddar cheese (sharp is good)
3 cups Bisquik

mix well, make little balls (~2tbsp ea, I guess) and plop 'em down on a cookie sheet and then
bake

I've now made these a couple times, with a couple minor variations, too, like using turkey
sausage for one batch so a non-pork-eater could have some.  The JD tubes are 3/4 lb, so
something like that works.  ('course, you want the bulk kind, 'cuz extracting links would
sux0r)

I'm told you can't taste the sausage... I'm not sure I entirely agree, but certainly the cheese
and bread type flavor is the predominant thinger.

I grate the cheese up, and then just throw everything in a big ol' bowl and start mixing with
my hands...  it takes a little while to get it all mashed together evently, but it's not too
bad.

I didn't get baking instructions, but my own experiments find that about 400F for like 17 or
18mins is good

Oh, and you can refridgerate the mixture for a couple days too, if needed, or if you're only
cooking some of it at once, etc.

kind of gross sounding, I guess, and kinda gross to mix up, but I find them yummy.  good party
snax, etc.  ayuh.

P.S.  I'd say sorry for the formatting, but I think news deals with this particular kind of
suckage these days, so, hopefully it's all good.
