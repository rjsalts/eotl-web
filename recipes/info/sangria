ok sangria is easy to make.  But i decided to start tryin
some weird stuff with it to make it wacky, and
here is my latest incarnation:

4 bottles of not cheapest but next-cheapest merlot.
This is actually how I shop for mixer alcohol.  Not bottom-shelf,
but 2nd to bottom-shelf.
3.50 a bottle is a good price.

1 can of cling peaches, quartered.  not the big halves, the little slices.
1 can of mandarin orange slices.  those little tiny ones with no seeds.
1 can of pineapple, chunk.  no crushed, no ring, chunks.
2 apples
2 pears
bout an 8th of a bottle of rum
1 bottle of lime flavored calistoga.  the liter sized bottle
1 bottle of lemon flavored calistoga. liter again.

chop up the apples and pears nice and small.
throw away the cores.
the key here is to have everything in this edible without spittin anythin out.

put everything into a big container, including the syrup and pineapple
juice from the cans, or, as I did, put it equally
into smaller containers.

let it sit for at LEAST 24 hours.

it really just keeps getting better.

serve.
should be really cold, it's a summer drink.


So my use of canned fruit is odd, but it came out mighty good.
--MORE-- (80%) 
the sparklinness of the calistoga gives a little bite, and eating
the fruit out of the bottom is just divine.
