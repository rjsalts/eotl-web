<p>
<tt>/open/bogleg/.quotes</tt> is a file containing (usually) humorous
tidbits.
Any Wizard can write to this file, so a lot of weirdness gets added
along with the funny stuff.
Below are excerpts from that file; items that are too obscure or
containing bad language have been left out (since we're a PG-13
web site).

      spelling something as simple as "deinonychus," which is a carnivorous
      dinosaur of the dromaeosauridae family (early Cretaceous).  But hey,
      that's why I always preferred theater to that history and science

Despite the detailed ideas, good experience, and beautiful formatting,
I cannot bring myself to approve an application containing the phrase,
"very unique".  This is a pet peeve of mine, and I will explain it 
here.  "Unique" means "one of a kind".  If something is unique, it
is the only one of its kind...to say something is more unique than
another unique object is folly.  It is a phrase used by ineloquent
people in a futile attempt to express an object's distinctiveness.<br>
