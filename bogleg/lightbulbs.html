<strong>Q:
    How many EotL mortals does it take to change a lightbulb?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong>
    None.  They can't.  The lightbulb only tells how to in the
    long description.
<p> 
<strong>Q:
    How many EotL Frobs does it take to change a lightbulb?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong>
    One, to <tt>cp</tt> it into his/her <tt>/usr</tt>, edit the short
    and long description,
    clone it, and then bug a no_finger'd Arch about being promoted to wizard
    because of this really neat lightbulb he/she just made.
<p> 
<strong>Q:
    How many EotL Wizards does it take to change a lightbulb?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong>
    One, to edit the code and find what the <tt>add_action</tt> is, and then
    give it to all
    of his/her friends after showing them how to get exp from it.
<p> 
<strong>Q:
    How many EotL Elders does it take to change a lightbulb?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong>
    Three.  One to find it and clone it and say how stupid it is on the Yahoo
    channel, one to post about how lame it is after hearing about it on
    Yahoo, and one to make a feeling about how lame the lightbulb is.
<p> 
<strong>Q:
    How many EotL Archwizards does it take to change a lightbulb?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong>
    One, to alter the core-code that the lightbulb inherits, thus breaking the
    lightbulb.
<p> 
<strong>Q:
    How many EotL Gods does it take to change a lightbulb?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong>
    One, to find out that the lightbulb is causing the mud to crash and then
    <tt>rm</tt> the damned thing.
