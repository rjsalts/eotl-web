/usr/death/workroom
A sepulchral throne room
   This is an underground cavern with a high arched ceiling.  In the corners
are piles of bones, and the floor is made of gravel that upon closer
inspection reveals itself to be made of ground shards of bone and teeth.  At
one end of this hall is a large throne, made entirely from bones.

---- The only obvious exit is east.
A magic vending machine.
A fire control console.
A smoothbore 18lb cannon.
An animated skeleton.
