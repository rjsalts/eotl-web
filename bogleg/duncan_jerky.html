<h2 align=center>Duncan Jerky</h2>

<p>
This log is from June 1993.<br>
One of EotL's more infamous wizards was Dragonbait.<br>
He had made several areas for the mud, including one
which contained a jerky-making machine.

In the Lobby
   The lobby is painted a deep olive green with a black outline. Dark
splotches
mar the look of a brightly polished floor, while the faint screaming scares
you.  On the lobby desk a brightly lit sign waits to be looked at, while a
large paper sits next to it.

---- Obvious exits are: west, north, south.
> l sign
Welcome to The Great Jerky Making Machine from the Sky!
the door to the north leads to the ladder up, and the employees only door
to the south that is unlocked leads to the machinery.

Near a Large, Rumbling Machine
   The machine you are standing near has all sorts of buttons and
levers.  A small sign is nailed into the machine, and looks like it has
the instructions on how to use it.

---- The only obvious exit is north.
A television set.
> l sign
Lever 1 - On off switch.
Button 1 - Freezing
Button 2 - Incinerate
Button 3 - Nukomatic

Standing on a Small Platform
   From the top of the blender you can see all of Impstine.  The small
antsized people running about, the busy carnival with all its wonders.  Even
the Haunted House and Mimpstilcatls Mansion can be seen.  Looking down from
this diving board of sorts, you can see the waiting jaws of the blender.  A
small sign sits near the end of the board.

---- The only obvious exit is down.
Duncan YoYo (net-dead).
A scale.
> push duncan
You shove duncan right off the edge!
Somebody laughs.
> goto somebody

Duncan can be seen screaming down the blender on the 90 inch monitor.
Those Dul-by speakers are GREAT!
Duncan is utterly sliced into tiny bits.  God, your glad they stuck
that 90 inch monitor in here.
You see The ghost of Duncan's corpse move along on the conveyor belt.
The oven looks REALLY hot.  Glad your not there.
A chute opens in the ceiling out out falls a bag.
Somebody picks up a bag of duncan jerky.
