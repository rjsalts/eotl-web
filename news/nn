  The administrators at Stanford, in their infinite wisdom, have become
concerned with the trafficking of bootleg software and pornography
information via the mud.  This is, of course, a ludicrous view, as is
obvious to any regular inhabitant of this multi user environment.  EOTL
is an open communications medium.  The administrators of this mud cannot
police what people say, anymore than telephone operators companies can
monitor what conversation goes over the telephone lines every day.
In order to be in total compliance with these requests, we would have to
institute monitoring of every single person who logs on this mud.
We have neither the computer resources nor the manpower to oversee such
activities, and even if we did, it would be of highly questionable ethics
to do so.  What we can do, in our limited power, is sitebanish any we
personally catch engaging in these illicit activities.  We must clamp
down on these activities, or this _game_ which we all enjoy will be shut
down.  EotL is a labor of love (and more than a bit of boredom) built by
the volunteer efforts of many around the world.  Its developers hail from
such far ranging locales as Russia, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and
Switzerland, and the demographics of its player population is even more
diverse.  We have law and precedent on our side (Compuserve was acquitted of
responsibility of such activities engaged on their network), but what
we do not have is the financial or legal resources to combat any move made
by outraged mothers who mistakenly lash out at the mud (laughably enough,
a text-based environment).  Try to behave.<br>
